# README

This is the main location where the web site content is stored.

There are two Git branches, `master` and `preview`.

Pushes to the `master` branch trigger automated builds which are
published at the main web address
([https://cronica-it.github.io/](https://cronica-it.github.io/)).

Please note that the Git repository name and the web site address
are identical; this is a GitHub naming convention for the main
project web sites.

Pushes to the `preview` branch trigger automated builds in the
`preview` Git repository, which are published at the inner web sub-address
([https://cronica-it.github.io/preview/](https://cronica-it.github.io/preview)).

The timeline events are stored in the `website/evenimente` folder,
and the memories in the `website/amintiri` folder. The format is
markdown.

The main content is in Romanian.

In October 1972, Robert E. Kahn organized a large, very successful demonstration of the ARPANET at the International Computer Communication Conference (ICCC).

This was the first public demonstration of this new network technology to the public. It was also in 1972 that the initial „hot” application, electronic mail, was introduced. In March Ray Tomlinson at BBN wrote the basic email message send and read software, motivated by the need of the ARPANET developers for an easy coordination mechanism. In July, Roberts expanded its utility by writing the first email utility program to list, selectively read, file, forward, and respond to messages. From there email took off as the largest network application for over a decade. This was a harbinger of the kind of activity we see on the World Wide Web today, namely, the enormous growth of all kinds of „people-to-people” traffic.
